//Assignment4 Multi-Threaded Producer Consumer Pipeline
//Matthew Wong CS344 Winter 2021
// Write a program that creates 4 threads to process input from standard input as follows:
//1. Thread 1: called the input thread reads in lines of characters from the standard input
//2. Thread 2: called the line separator thread replaces every line separator in the input by a space
//3. Thread 3: callled the plus sign thread replcaes every pair of plus signs, ie "++" by a "^"
//4. thread 4: called the output thread, write the processed data to standard output as lines of exactly 80 characters
// The threads must communicate with each other using the producer-consumer approach
