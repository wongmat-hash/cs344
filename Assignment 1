Here is a sample file whose format corresponds to the format of the CSV file your program will be tested with.

The first line in the input file will always be the header line containing the column headers (i.e., it will not have data for a movie).
All the other lines will have the data for a movie in valid format and no columns will be missing.
The file will not have any empty lines.
The file will contain data for at least one movie.
Don't assume a maximum number of movies in the file.
Commas appear as delimiters between columns, but will not appear in the values of any columns.
The name of the input file will be less than 50 characters and will not contain any spaces.
Don't assume that the input file name will have a particular extension.
This file has the following columns:
